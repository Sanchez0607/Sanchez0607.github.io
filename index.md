## Favorite CPSC 120 Labs

* Lab 3, part 2 

    This was a fun lab because it helped me understand how to break the problem into smaller steps. I learned how to turn a regular date into a Julian day number and then used that to find the difference between two dates. It also helped me practice using functions and organizing my code in a way that actually made sense to me.  

* Lab 6, part 1 

    This was my second favorite lab because I finally understood how to use command-line arguments. Getting the protein, bread, and condiments from the user and printing the order made the code easy to follow. It helped me feel more comfortable working with strings and vectors. It also made me feel more confident using command-line tools in general because once I saw how the arguments worked, the whole process finally made sense to me. 

* Lab 10, part 1 

    This was my favorite lab because it helped me understand how to work with vectors that store other vectors. I learned how to loop through the county data, pull out each county name, and convert the population from a string to an integer. It also showed me how to add everything together to find the total population. It made the whole assignment feel easier once I understood how everything worked together.
